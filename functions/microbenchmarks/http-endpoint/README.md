# HTTP Endpoint 

In this directory, the HTTP endpoint functions to respond the current time are provided in *Python*, *NodeJS*, *Ruby*, and *Swift*.

The *Python* and *Swift* benchmarks are originally from the Serverless Examples repo (https://github.com/serverless/examples). However, they were modified/simplified to work directly with the OpenWhisk platform.
